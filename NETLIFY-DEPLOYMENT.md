## 🎯 Step 1: GitHub Setup

### Prerequisites
Before proceeding, you need to complete GitHub authorization through the code sandbox interface:

1. **GitHub Authorization Required**:
   - Go to the **#github** tab in your code sandbox interface
   - Complete GitHub App authorization
   - Set up OAuth authorization if needed
   - Configure repository access permissions

2. **After GitHub Setup**:
   - The `setup_github_environment` tool will be able to configure authentication
   - Git credentials will be configured globally in the sandbox
   - You'll be able to push code to your GitHub repositories

### Create GitHub Repository

Once GitHub is set up, you have two options:

#### Option A: Use Existing Repository (Recommended)
If you have an existing GitHub repository you'd like to use:
1. The setup will provide information about your available repositories
2. Use an existing repository URL from the setup output

#### Option B: Create New Repository
If you need a new repository:
1. Create a new repository on GitHub.com
2. Name it `whohub` or similar
3. Make it public (required for free Netlify)
4. Don't initialize with README (we have files ready)

### Push Code to GitHub

After GitHub setup is complete:
```bash
cd /home/user/whohub

# Add GitHub remote (replace with your actual repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/whohub.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## 🎯 Step 2: Netlify Deployment

### Create Netlify Account
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Sign up with your GitHub account (recommended)
3. This automatically connects Netlify to your GitHub repositories

### Deploy from GitHub

1. **New Site from Git**:
   - Click "New site from Git" on Netlify dashboard
   - Choose "GitHub" as your Git provider
   - Authorize Netlify to access your repositories

2. **Select Repository**:
   - Find and select your `whohub` repository
   - Click on it to proceed

3. **Configure Build Settings**:
   ```
   Branch to deploy: main
   Build command: (leave empty - static site)
   Publish directory: (leave empty - deploys from root)
   ```

4. **Deploy Site**:
   - Click "Deploy site"
   - Netlify will assign a random URL like `https://magical-unicorn-123456.netlify.app`

### Configure Site Settings

1. **Change Site Name**:
   - Go to Site settings → General → Site details
   - Change site name to `whohub`
   - Your URL becomes: `https://whohub.netlify.app`

2. **Enable Form Processing**:
   - Forms are already configured with `data-netlify="true"`
   - Netlify automatically detects and enables form processing
   - No additional setup needed!

3. **Custom Domain (Optional)**:
   - Go to Site settings → Domain management
   - Click "Add custom domain"
   - Enter: `www.whohub.com.au`
   - Follow DNS configuration instructions

## 🎯 Step 3: Testing Your Deployment

### Verify Website Functionality
1. **Visit Your Site**: https://whohub.netlify.app
2. **Test Features**:
   - ✅ Homepage loads with WhoHub branding
   - ✅ Navigation menu works on mobile/desktop
   - ✅ All images load correctly
   - ✅ Early access form submits successfully
   - ✅ Thank you page displays after form submission

### Test Form Processing
1. **Submit Early Access Form**:
   - Fill out the form completely
   - Click "Join Early Access Program"
   - Should redirect to `/thank-you` page

2. **Check Form Submissions**:
   - Go to Netlify dashboard → Site → Forms
   - You should see form submissions listed
   - Download submissions as CSV if needed

## 🎯 Step 4: Production Configuration

### Environment Variables (Optional)
If you need to add environment variables:
1. Go to Site settings → Build & deploy → Environment variables
2. Add variables like:
   - `GA_TRACKING_ID`: Your Google Analytics ID
   - `CONTACT_EMAIL`: Your contact email

### Custom Domain Setup

#### For www.whohub.com.au:
1. **Add Domain in Netlify**:
   - Site settings → Domain management
   - Add custom domain: `www.whohub.com.au`
   - Add apex domain: `whohub.com.au`

2. **DNS Configuration**:
   If using external DNS (like GoDaddy):
   ```
   Type: CNAME
   Name: www
   Value: whohub.netlify.app
   
   Type: ALIAS or ANAME (if supported) or A record
   Name: @
   Value: 75.2.60.5 (Netlify's load balancer)
   ```

3. **SSL Certificate**:
   - Netlify automatically provides SSL certificates
   - Usually takes 1-24 hours to provision
   - Your site will be accessible via HTTPS

### Analytics Setup

#### Google Analytics 4:
1. Create GA4 property for your domain
2. Get Measurement ID (G-XXXXXXXXXX)
3. Uncomment and update analytics code in `index.html`:

```html
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script>
    window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
    function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
    gtag('js', new Date());
    gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
</script>
```

4. Commit and push changes to GitHub
5. Netlify automatically redeploys

## 🎯 Step 5: Ongoing Management

### Automatic Deployments
- Every push to `main` branch triggers automatic deployment
- No manual intervention needed
- Deploy previews for pull requests

### Form Management
1. **Access Submissions**:
   - Netlify dashboard → Forms
   - Download CSV exports
   - Set up email notifications

2. **Email Notifications**:
   - Site settings → Forms → Form notifications
   - Add notification to email address
   - Customize notification content

### Performance Monitoring
1. **Analytics**:
   - Netlify provides basic analytics
   - Site settings → Analytics
   - View traffic, top pages, sources

2. **Performance**:
   - Site is already optimized for speed
   - CDN enabled globally
   - Security headers configured
