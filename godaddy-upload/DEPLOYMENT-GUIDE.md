## 🎯 Step-by-Step GoDaddy Upload Instructions

### Step 1: Access Your GoDaddy Hosting Account

1. **Log into GoDaddy**:
   - Go to https://www.godaddy.com
   - Sign in to your account
   - Navigate to "My Products" → "Web Hosting"

2. **Access cPanel/File Manager**:
   - Click "Manage" next to your hosting account
   - Find and click "File Manager" or "cPanel"

### Step 2: Navigate to Your Website Directory

1. **Locate public_html folder**:
   - In File Manager, look for `public_html` folder
   - This is where your website files go
   - `public_html` = your website root (www.whohub.com.au)

2. **Clean existing files (if any)**:
   - Select any existing files in public_html
   - Delete them (backup first if needed)
   - You want a clean slate for WhoHub

### Step 3: Upload WhoHub Files

1. **Upload main files**:
   - Upload `index.html` to the root of `public_html/`
   - This becomes your homepage

2. **Create and upload directories**:
   - Create folder: `css/` in public_html
   - Upload `styles.css` to `public_html/css/`
   
   - Create folder: `js/` in public_html  
   - Upload `main.js` to `public_html/js/`
   
   - Create folder: `images/` in public_html
   - Upload both logo files to `public_html/images/`

### Step 4: Verify File Structure

Your final structure should look like:
```
public_html/
├── index.html
├── css/
│   └── styles.css
├── js/
│   └── main.js
└── images/
    ├── whohub-logo.png
    └── whohub-logo-tagline.png
```

### Step 5: Test Your Website

1. **Visit your website**:
   - Go to https://www.whohub.com.au
   - The WhoHub homepage should load

2. **Test functionality**:
   - Check mobile responsiveness
   - Test navigation menu
   - Submit early access form (stores locally)
   - Verify all images load

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration (Optional)

### Custom 404 Error Page

Create `404.html` in public_html:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Page Not Found - WhoHub</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <section class="hero">
        <div class="container">
            <div class="hero-content">
                <img src="./images/whohub-logo.png" alt="WhoHub" class="hero-logo" style="height: 200px;">
                <h1>Page Not Found</h1>
                <p class="subtitle">The page you're looking for doesn't exist.</p>
                <div class="hero-cta">
                    <a href="/" class="btn btn-primary">Return Home</a>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </section>
</body>
</html>
```

### .htaccess Configuration

Create `.htaccess` file in public_html for better performance:
```apache
# Enable GZIP compression
<IfModule mod_deflate.c>
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/plain
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/xml
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/css
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/xml
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/xhtml+xml
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/rss+xml
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/javascript
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/x-javascript
</IfModule>

# Browser caching
<IfModule mod_expires.c>
    ExpiresActive on
    ExpiresByType text/css "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType application/javascript "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/png "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/jpg "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/jpeg "access plus 1 year"
</IfModule>

# Security headers
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
    Header always set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff
    Header always set X-Frame-Options DENY
    Header always set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"
</IfModule>
```

## 📧 Contact Form Setup (Next Steps)

The current form stores submissions locally. For production, you'll need:

### Option 1: GoDaddy Email Forms
- Use GoDaddy's built-in form processing
- Configure in your hosting control panel
- Update form action in `index.html`

### Option 2: Third-party Service
- FormSubmit.co (free)
- Formspree.io  
- Netlify Forms

### Option 3: PHP Processing
Create `process-form.php`:
```php
<?php
if ($_POST['email']) {
    $to = 'hello@whohub.com.au';
    $subject = 'WhoHub Early Access Request';
    $message = "Name: " . $_POST['name'] . "\n";
    $message .= "Email: " . $_POST['email'] . "\n";
    $message .= "Interest: " . $_POST['interest'] . "\n";
    $message .= "Message: " . $_POST['message'] . "\n";
    
    $headers = 'From: noreply@whohub.com.au' . "\r\n";
    
    if (mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers)) {
        echo json_encode(['success' => true]);
    } else {
        echo json_encode(['success' => false]);
    }
} else {
    echo json_encode(['success' => false]);
}
?>
```

Then update form action in `index.html`:
```html
<form id="early-access-form" class="contact-form" action="process-form.php" method="POST">
```

## 📊 Analytics Setup (Recommended)

### Google Analytics 4
1. Create GA4 property for whohub.com.au
2. Get your Measurement ID (G-XXXXXXXXXX)
3. Uncomment and update analytics code in `index.html`:

```html
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script>
    window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
    function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
    gtag('js', new Date());
    gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
</script>
```

### Google Search Console
1. Add and verify whohub.com.au
2. Submit sitemap (create sitemap.xml)
3. Monitor search performance
